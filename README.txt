Get Hash is a small tool which lets you calculate all common hashes (MD5, RIPEMD, SHA ...) of files and texts, for example, to check hashed passwords or downloaded files. The tool is characterized mainly by its simple design and intuitive ease of operation.
The installer for the current version can be found at http://mischolz.de/?page_id=46

Feel free to send me implementations of further hash-algorithms, patches or translations.
