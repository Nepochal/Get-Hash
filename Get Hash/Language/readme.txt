If you want to translate the program, simply copy one of the existing language-files and
insert the language name between <Language> and </Language>,
insert a short description between <Description> and </Description>,
translate all the texts between <Value> and </Value>.

Please send a copy of your new translation-file to development@mischolz.de so that it can be included in the next version and everyone can use it.
